Hi, my name is Anthony — welcome to my blog!

Here, I’m going to be sharing updates on my projects, thoughts, and anything else I feel like putting out into the world. I’m super excited to start this because I know it’ll help me mentally a lot. I have a pretty terrible memory and tend to get lost in my life easily. Writing here will keep me anchored.

I attend Erie High School for my Computer Science class, but for my core classes, I’m online. Hybrid school has been working really well for me, and I’m genuinely enjoying it.

Thanks for stopping by, more posts coming soon!
