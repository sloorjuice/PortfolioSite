Hey guys! first off, I've haven't written a blog post in a while, thats because I've been enjoying my summer big time! But theres the question, what have I been up to? Well i definitely haven't been up to nothing. 
<br/><br/>
Other than hanging out with my friends and girlfriend, going out and doing fun things, enjoying the new Switch 2 with DK Banzanza, etc. Ive been working on my **Dream Project iSkate**. You can check out iSkate here: [iSkate.app](https://iskate.app). I've been very excited about it and i've been working on it day and night, but I definitely should've and need to slow my roll a bit. Instead of taking my time and learning about the things I had to integrate I instead opted to using tools like Co-Pilot to "speed up" the progress of the app, but it lead to things like me not understanding all the code, it just being bad and messy code, terrible app performance, and all around an app that looked good on the surface but was terrible under the hood and had horrible performance.
<br/><br/>
Despite that all the app is still a really good prototype of what i want iSkate to be, with a quality backend I've put together with Firebase. I plan to leave the iSkate prototype the way it is and soon work on a genuine version of the app where I take my time and leak out the copilot. In the mean time I want to refine my skills and work on smaller easier more realistic projects and goals.

I'm completing the [Expo React Native Tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/) which is something I Haven't done before. It's quite an easy project that is actually teaching me a lot I didn't know.
<br/><br/>
Soon after I complete the [Expo React Native Tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/) I'm going to start working on my new project idea... which is an react native app i don't have a name for yet... but I plan to get it done before the end of the month hopefully!

These are my notes for the project and hopefully you can see what I'm going for. I wanted to create something that will actually help me in my day to day life and hopefully others like me. It seems like a simple project to create and further expand on it as much as I want. A project I can actually start and finish and put out into the world and feel accomplished about. I plan to start keeping a devlog of this project here so soon i'll add a subscribe feature to this blog incase you wanna keep up with my projects. 

Thanks for reading!
