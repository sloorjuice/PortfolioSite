- The main thing i did today was add pokemon of the day using the pokeapi!!!
- I have used this API before so it was a real easy function to call the api and then I just threw it on the games page!

- I also fixed my capitalization and grammar for the word of the day as in v1.0 it was all lowercase, a pretty sad oversight on my part.

- Lately I've also gotten a lot better with using Git. Now I've added a "Development" branch and now I make a branch for every feature so that I can test the features before I add them to the dev branch, so that now I can push all the features and fixes as one big update, so be on the lookout!
